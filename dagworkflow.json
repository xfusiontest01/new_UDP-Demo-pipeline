Options are: ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream`` When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where downstream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete before starting upstream tasks of other dags. When set to ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight`` specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when you know exactly what priority weight each task should have. Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large DAGS.
